# Balloon Burst Game

A fun and interactive balloon inflating and popping game built with **Phaser 3**. The player inflates a balloon by clicking the pump, and when fully inflated, the balloon floats away. Clicking the balloon at the right time will pop it!

## Features 🎈
- **Pump & Inflate**: Click the pump to gradually inflate the balloon.
- **Floating Animation**: Once fully inflated, the balloon floats from right to left while moving upward.
- **Pop Mechanism**: Click the balloon while it's floating to pop it.
- **Automatic Respawn**: A new balloon spawns immediately after the previous one floats away or is popped.
- **Realistic Physics**: Smooth movement using Phaser's physics engine.
